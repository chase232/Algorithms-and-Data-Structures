# ExecutionTimeSorting 

This program outputs the execution time of certain sorting methods with various 
    array sizes.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

The problem asked for output of six different sorting methods and the execution 
    times for various array sizes.

### Design

I first started by creating the header with the array sizes. I then made a nested
    for loop for each sorting method. The nested for loops were used to increment 
    the array size and create a random array. The random array was passed to the 
    specific sorting method and the execution time was returned. 

### Testing

I first tested by making sure my output looked right. I then tested each sorting 
    method to make sure everything was outputting correctly.
